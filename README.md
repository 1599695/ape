# 1. PROJECT GRADING SPECIFICATIONS 

	* INTRODUCTION 
Dimensions: 3D
Levels/Stages: 3
Medium: Chrome or Firefox on Ubuntu
Browser: Three.js
Demonstrate Mastery of: Hierarchical Modelling, Viewing and Camera, lighting and Materials
Bonus: Polish (put effort into look and feel of game beyond HTML and Three.js), Innovation(e.g Networking, Multi-player, special effects, novel models, animated models)
Permissions: Reference and Acknowledge all characters and textures from online in a credits screen in the game.

	* GRADING(Alpha Demonstration Question Answers)
Viewing(10%): 3D Scene, Animated, 
Control(10%): Keyboard and mouse controls required.
Playability(10%): Has Objective, fail and succeed at objective, competitive and fun, played in all 3 dimensions, working physics model.
3D Effects(15%): antialiasing, depth tests, colour, multiple light sources, smooth/flat shading, curves, surfaces, static/dynamic skyboxes, shadows, reflections, refractions.
Coding Style(10%): sensible  declaration names, indented, commented, documented, version-controlled(git), OOP. As SD Design 
Design Style(25%): Quality of hierarchical Modelling and motivation of that design. Explain how world/objects/subjects are modelled and why. Pros and cons.
Polish(10%): Colour scheme, dashboard/in-game menu, restart rather than having to refresh the page., shouldn't lag(late responses).
Innovation(10%): Own Models/Textures designed in Blender. *OpenAI self-play(Multiplayer)*, increase board size on next level (8,9,10), *Add VR functionality, Sound, Efficiency,  Speed*.
** => Sugestions if time permits.

	* ASSESSMENT  
	                                         * Alpha: Not for marks. (08 May 2020)
  - Three.js must be running.
	- Preliminary implementation to illustrate what the game will look like.
	- Rubric walk through.
	- Answer questions about how you implemented/plan to implement the required functionality for each aspect of the rubric.

	                                        * Beta: Graded.  (22 May 2020)
  - Demonstrate the game, and answer questions about design choices, special effects etc.
	- Can have minor bugs.
	- Can have 1 or 2 incomplete levels, but must be almost ready for production.
	- Last chance to get formal feedback.

                                          * Final: Rubric Graded. (05 June 2020)
   - Demonstrate game multiple times.
   - Max 2-page pdf  describing/analysing/motivating/criticizing design decisions.
   - Practical exam mark.
